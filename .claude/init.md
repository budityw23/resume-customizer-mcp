# Project Configuration

This file contains custom instructions for Claude Code when working on this project.

## Git Commit Guidelines

When creating git commits, do NOT include the following footer:

```
🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Instead, create clean commit messages without attribution footers.
