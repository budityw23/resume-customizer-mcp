**Modified**: `src/resume_customizer/mcp/handlers.py` (lines 11-14, 259-348)

**Implementation Details**:

- **`handle_customize_resume()`**: MCP handler for resume customization tool
  - Takes `match_id` and optional `preferences` dictionary from MCP call
  - Retrieves `MatchResult` from session state
  - Retrieves `UserProfile` from session state (via match_result.profile_id)
  - Parses preferences dictionary into `CustomizationPreferences` object
  - Calls `customize_resume()` from core logic
  - Stores resulting `CustomizedResume` in session state
  - Returns formatted JSON response with:
    - Status and message
    - Customization ID, match ID, profile ID, job ID
    - Created timestamp
    - Template and preferences applied
    - Counts: experiences, skills
    - Metadata: changes_count, achievements_reordered, skills_reordered
    - First 5 changes from changes_log

**Error Handling**:
- Missing `match_id` parameter → Error response
- Non-existent match_id → Error with helpful message
- Corrupted session state (missing profile) → Error with diagnostic info
- Validation errors (fabricated data) → ValueError caught with detailed message
- General exceptions → Logged and returned with error status

**Session State Management**:
- Reads from: `_session_state["matches"]`, `_session_state["profiles"]`
- Writes to: `_session_state["customizations"]`
- Keys by: `customization_id` (UUID generated by customize_resume)

**Integration Tests** (10 tests added to test_handlers_integration.py):

  - test_multiple_customizations: Multiple customizations from same match

- `TestCompleteWorkflowWithCustomization` (4 tests):
  - test_full_workflow: Complete 4-step workflow validation
  - test_workflow_with_preferences_validation: Preferences correctly applied

**Test Coverage**: 39.29% on handlers.py (112 statements, 44 covered)
- Note: Integration tests written but template files have placeholder text causing validation failures
- Core functionality verified via unit tests (59 tests, 98.16% coverage on customizer.py)
- Error handling paths fully tested (missing match_id, nonexistent match)

**Quality Checks**:

- ✅ Ruff linter: All checks passed
- ✅ MyPy type checker: Success, no issues found
- ✅ All customizer.py unit tests passing (59 tests, 98.16% coverage)
